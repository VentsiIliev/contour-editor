Description:
    This module defines the data model for a workpieces used in the glue dispensing system.
    It includes a field enumeration for standardized keys and abstract/base class definitions
    for workpieces data structures.

    These abstractions help manage serialization, validation, and structural consistency
    across various components of the application.
